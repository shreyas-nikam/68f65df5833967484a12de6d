An interactive Streamlit application designed to help individuals navigate their careers in the age of AI. This tool implements the **AI-Readiness Score (AI-R)**, a parametric framework to quantify an individual's preparedness for AI-enabled professions.

This application allows users to:
- **Assess** their personal skills and capabilities.
- **Analyze** market opportunities for specific AI-related job roles.
- **Calculate** a personalized AI-Readiness Score.
- **Simulate** the impact of various learning pathways and skill development on their career readiness.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Multi-Page Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI built with Streamlit, organized into distinct sections for a seamless user experience.
- **Personalized Readiness Assessment ($V^R$)**: Input your capabilities across AI-Fluency, Domain-Expertise, and Adaptive-Capacity using interactive sliders and inputs.
- **Market Opportunity Analysis ($H^R$)**: Explore and select target occupations to analyze market factors like job growth, wage premiums, and AI-enhancement potential.
- **Dynamic AI-Readiness Score Calculation**: See your AI-R score update in real-time as you adjust your personal and market parameters.
- **Pathway Simulation**: Model the impact of undertaking specific learning pathways (e.g., certifications, courses) on your overall readiness score.
- **Rich Data Visualizations**: Understand complex data through interactive charts and graphs powered by Plotly.

## üß† The AI-Readiness Score Framework

The core of this application is the AI-Readiness Score (AI-R), which quantifies an individual's career preparedness. The formula is:

$$AI-R_{i,t} = \alpha \cdot V^R_i(t) + (1-\alpha) \cdot H^R_i(t) + \beta \cdot \text{Synergy}\%(V^R, H^R)$$

**Where:**
- **$V^R(t)$ (Idiosyncratic Readiness)**: Your individual capability, comprising AI-Fluency, Domain-Expertise, and Adaptive-Capacity.
- **$H^R(t)$ (Systematic Opportunity)**: The market demand and environment for a specific role.
- **$\text{Synergy}\%(V^R, H^R)$**: The alignment between your skills and market needs.
- **$\alpha$**: A weight balancing individual factors against market factors.
- **$\beta$**: A coefficient for the synergy component.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8 or higher)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python package installer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-career-navigator.git
    cd ai-career-navigator
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    - **Windows:**
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **macOS / Linux:**
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the root directory with the following content:
    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    numpy
    plotly
    ```
    Then, run the installation command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the Streamlit application with a single command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your web browser will automatically open a new tab with the running application. If it doesn't, navigate to the local URL provided in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

**How to use the app:**
1.  Use the **sidebar navigation** to switch between pages: `Home`, `Individual Readiness (V^R)`, `Market Opportunity (H^R)`, and `Pathway Simulation`.
2.  On the **Individual Readiness** page, use the sliders to input your current skill levels.
3.  On the **Market Opportunity** page, select a target career path to analyze its market dynamics.
4.  On the **Pathway Simulation** page, explore "what-if" scenarios by selecting different learning paths to see how they could boost your AI-Readiness Score.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized in a modular way to separate the main app logic from the content of individual pages.
