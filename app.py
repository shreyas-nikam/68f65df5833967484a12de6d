## Welcome to the AI Career Navigator & Pathway Planner

In this lab, you will explore the **AI-Readiness Score (AI-R)** framework, a comprehensive parametric model designed to quantify an individual's preparedness for AI-enabled careers. This interactive application enables you to:

- **Understand** the decomposition of the AI-Readiness Score into its core components
- **Calculate** your personal AI-R score based on individual capabilities and market opportunities
- **Simulate** the impact of various learning pathways on your career readiness
- **Analyze** different career paths through dynamic "what-if" scenarios

### The AI-Readiness Score Framework

The AI-Readiness Score combines three essential dimensions:

1. **Idiosyncratic Readiness ($V^R$)**: Your individual capabilities across AI-Fluency, Domain-Expertise, and Adaptive-Capacity
2. **Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$)**: Market demand and growth potential for AI-enabled occupations
3. **Synergy Component**: The alignment between your skills and market requirements

The core formula is:

st.latex(r\"\"\"AI-R_{i,t} = \\alpha \\cdot V^R_i(t) + (1-\\alpha) \\cdot H^R_i(t) + \\beta \\cdot \\text{Synergy}\\%(V^R, H^R)\"\"\")

Where:
- $V^R(t)$ is your **Idiosyncratic Readiness** (normalized to [0, 100])
- $H^R(t)$ is the **Systematic Opportunity** for your target occupation (normalized to [0, 100])
- $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ weights individual vs. market factors
- $\\beta > 0$ amplifies the synergy when skills align with market needs
- **Synergy%** captures the alignment between your capabilities and market demands (normalized to [0, 100])

This framework empowers you to make data-driven career decisions and optimize your learning investments.
